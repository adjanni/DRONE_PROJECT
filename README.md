# DRONE_PROJECT
 
 The project aims at simulating the physical ability of a drone:
 (1-) to start when triggers by a or the user(s)
 (2-) to take off
 (3-) to move in two planes
 (4-) to land
 I will try to follow the Agile software development steps that I find result-oriented.
 
 ## UML diagrams
 ### UML user case diagram
 In this part, I identify on the set of actions that the drone must and should perform in collaboration with one or many external users.
 
 The drone `must do' ...
 - have a user interface
 - communicate (at a long or short range) with the user
 - must be able to fly
 - Navigate in two dimensions. In the future, it must be able to perform a target pursuit or a route control
 - Future functionalities: collision avoidance, image analysis, and live streaming videos

 
 
 The drone `should do' ...
 - start upon request
 - low power
