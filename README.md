### DRONE_PROJECT
 
 The project aims at simulating the physical ability of a drone:
 - To start when triggers by a or the user(s)
 - To take off
 - To move in two planes
 - To land
 I will try to follow the Agile software development steps that I find result-oriented.
 
 ## UML diagrams

 In this part, I identify on the set of actions that the drone must and should perform in collaboration with one or many external users.
